# Archived Pre-Commit Docs (2025-12-06)

These files were superseded by the unified `docs/development/PRE_COMMIT_GUIDE.md`:

- `PRE_COMMIT_AUTOMATION.md`
- `PRECOMMIT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
- `pre-commit-workflow.md`

Reason: Reduce duplication and centralize guidance. Refer to the new guide for all current workflows.
