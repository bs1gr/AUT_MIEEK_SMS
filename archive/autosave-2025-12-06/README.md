# Archived Autosave Docs (2025-12-06)

Superseded by updates to `docs/development/AUTOSAVE_PATTERN.md` which now includes coverage, auth review, and troubleshooting.

Archived files:

- `AUTOSAVE_SUMMARY.md`
- `AUTOSAVE_EXTENSION_SESSION.md`
- `AUTOSAVE_AUTH_REVIEW.md`

Reason: reduce duplication and keep a single autosave reference. Full historical detail remains available here.
