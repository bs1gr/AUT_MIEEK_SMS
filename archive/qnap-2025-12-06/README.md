# Archived QNAP Deployment Docs (2025-12-06)

These documents were superseded by `docs/deployment/QNAP_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE_COMPLETE.md`:

- `QNAP.md`
- `QNAP_DEPLOYMENT_SUMMARY.md`
- `QNAP_TS-431P3_COMPATIBILITY.md`
- `QNAP_TS-431P3_ARM_BUILD_GUIDE.md`
- `QNAP_VIRTUAL_HOST_DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md`

Rationale: reduce duplication and provide a single entrypoint; the archived files still contain the deep, step-by-step plans (ARM builds, virtual host configuration, compatibility matrices).
