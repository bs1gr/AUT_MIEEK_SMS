# Archived CI/CD Docs (2025-12-06)

Superseded by `docs/deployment/CI_CD_PIPELINE_GUIDE.md`.

Archived files:

- `ci-cd-implementation.md`
- `.github/CI_IMPROVEMENTS.md`
- `.github/CI_CHANGELOG.md`

Reason: keep one canonical pipeline guide; the archived files retain historical context and change logs.
