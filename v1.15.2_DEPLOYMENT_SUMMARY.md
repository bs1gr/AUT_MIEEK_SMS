## 🎓 Key Points for Deployment Team

### Must Know
- This is RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) implementation
- 65 admin endpoints are now permission-protected
- User-facing features are unchanged
- Full backward compatibility maintained
- Rollback is quick and safe

### Common Questions
- **Q: Will users be affected?** A: No, user-facing features unchanged.
- **Q: Will there be downtime?** A: Minimal (15-30 min if needed).
- **Q: What if something breaks?** A: Rollback to v1.15.1 in <5 minutes.
- **Q: How are permissions managed?** A: Via API or seeding script.
- **Q: Is database migration needed?** A: Yes, Alembic handles it automatically.

### Special Considerations
- RBAC decorator applied to 65 endpoints
- Permission checks run at <1ms latency
- Database migration creates 3 new tables
- No schema changes to existing tables
- Backward compatible with v1.15.1 data
