feat(monitoring): Add on-demand monitoring stack with lazy activation

Major Features:
- On-demand monitoring activation via Power page (/power) and Control API
- Lazy-loading dashboards reduce initial resource footprint by ~500-600MB
- Backward-compatible eager mode (RUN.ps1 -WithMonitoring)
- Enhanced update workflow with -Update (fast) and -UpdateNoCache (clean) flags
- Comprehensive monitoring documentation suite

Monitoring Control:
- New endpoints: /control/api/monitoring/{status,start,stop}
- Structured audit logging for all monitoring lifecycle events
- Rate limiting (5 req/min) and host-only execution for security
- Integration with Power page UI (loading states, health checks)

Scripts & Operations:
- RUN.ps1: Added -Update/-UpdateNoCache flags, deprecated -FastUpdate
- SMS.ps1: Enhanced with interactive menu and unified stop functionality
- Automatic backup creation before all updates

Documentation:
- docs/MONITORING_ARCHITECTURE.md: Complete architecture guide
- monitoring/README.md: Configuration quick reference
- backend/CONTROL_API.md: Control endpoints with audit logging specs
- Fixed all markdown lint issues across docs

Security:
- Host-only monitoring control (blocked from within container)
- Heavy rate limiting on lifecycle endpoints
- Security hardening checklist for production
- Audit logging with request_id and client_host metadata

Infrastructure:
- Prometheus, Grafana, Loki stack in docker-compose.monitoring.yml
- Pre-configured dashboards: Application Health, Infrastructure, Logs
- Alert rules for API and business metrics
- Promtail log collection from backend and containers

Cleanup:
- Archived 18 temporary/redundant documentation files
- Consolidated monitoring docs (removed 5 duplicates)
- Updated DOCUMENTATION_INDEX with v1.7.0 references

Breaking Changes: None (backward compatible)

Closes: Monitoring integration initiative
Version: 1.7.0
