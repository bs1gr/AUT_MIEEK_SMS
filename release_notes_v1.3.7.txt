Release v1.3.7 — Maintenance & CI hardening

This maintenance release collects a set of non-destructive repository hardening and CI/workflow fixes intended to make contributions and diagnostics more reliable.

Highlights
- Make Alembic migrations runner `backend/run_migrations.py` cwd-agnostic and log migrations output to `logs/migrations.log` so CI and maintainers can easily inspect migration runs.
- Hardened GitHub Actions workflows: fixed run-migrations artifact uploads, ensured `backend/data` and `logs/` directories are created in CI, and added `workflow_dispatch` triggers to key workflows (CI, mypy, pre-commit, ruff, secret-guard) to enable manual runs.
- Non-destructive repo hygiene: added `.gitignore` entries for temporary artifacts, untracked large generated files (kept local copies), and added `scripts/clean_tmp_artifacts.ps1` for safe cleanup.
- QA: ran `pytest`, `ruff` and `mypy` locally; applied safe `ruff` formatting fixes where needed.
- Documentation: added `docs/CI-LOGS.md` and `docs/HISTORY_PURGE_PLAN.md` describing logs, release attachments, and a safe plan for optional history purges (no history rewrite performed in this release).

Notes for maintainers
- No destructive history rewrite was performed. If you want to permanently remove large files from history, follow `docs/HISTORY_PURGE_PLAN.md` and coordinate with collaborators.
- Release assets attached: migrations.log, pytest-output.txt, setup.log (diagnostic artifacts useful for debugging CI/migration issues).

If you need additional artifacts attached to this release, or want the agent to proceed with an authorized history-rewrite, reply with approval and specifics.
