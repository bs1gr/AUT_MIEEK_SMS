# Release v1.3.5 (Draft)

Release date: 2025-11-02

Summary
-------
- CI & Quality: Added repo-wide type checking (mypy) job and ensured mypy is available in backend dev requirements.
- Migrations: Hardened migration runner (`backend/run_migrations.py`) and added recommended Kubernetes one-shot migrate job (see `deploy/k8s/migrate-job.yaml`).
- Docs & Runbook: Added `docs/MIGRATION_RUNBOOK.md` with operator instructions for running migrations safely in production.
- Repo hygiene: Untracked frontend vendor files (`/frontend/node_modules`, `/frontend/dist`) and updated `.gitignore`.
- Tests: Backend test suite passes locally; pre-commit hooks and ruff checks pass.

Operator notes
--------------
- To run migrations safely in a cluster, use the provided `deploy/k8s/migrate-job.yaml` Job that runs `backend/migrate_job.py` in a single-run Pod.
- The `backend/run_migrations.py` module is used by the FastAPI lifespan to programmatically apply Alembic migrations on startup.
