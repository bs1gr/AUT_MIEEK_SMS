  - `/health/ready` readiness probe verified ✅
  - `/health/live` liveness probe verified ✅
  - Multi-endpoint fallback strategy confirmed ✅

#### 2. ✅ Environment Configuration Audit (Complete)

- **E2E Environment Variables**:
  - `CSRF_ENABLED: '0'` ✅
  - `AUTH_MODE: permissive` ✅
  - `SERVE_FRONTEND: '1'` ✅
  - `DATABASE_URL: sqlite:///./data/student_management.db` ✅

- **Load Testing Environment**:
  - `AUTH_MODE: disabled` ✅
  - Rate limits effectively disabled ✅
  - Appropriate for peak performance measurement ✅

- **Test Environment**:
  - In-memory DB strategy ✅
  - CSRF disabled for TestClient ✅
  - All rate limiters disabled ✅

#### 3. ✅ Error Recovery & Debugging (Complete)

- **E2E Tests**:
  - Fallback health checks (root `/`, `/api`) ✅
  - Process status checks on failure ✅
  - Backend logs captured on failure ✅
  - Playwright reports and videos retained ✅

- **Artifact Management**:
  - Test results uploaded (30-day retention) ✅
  - Backend logs uploaded (7-day retention) ✅
  - Load test reports uploaded (90-day retention) ✅

#### 4. ✅ Dependency Chain Verification (Complete)

- E2E tests properly depend on backend startup ✅
- Load tests configured as manual/scheduled ✅
- Commit tests isolated with in-memory DB ✅
- Artifact dependencies properly configured ✅

## ✨ Post-Merge Action Plan

### Immediate (First 24 hours)

1. ✅ Code review of 4 modified workflow files
2. ✅ Merge to main branch
3. ⏳ Monitor first workflow run (commit-ready smoke test)
4. ⏳ Verify no new errors in GitHub Actions UI

### Short-term (First week)

1. Monitor E2E test execution
   - Check health check completes within timeout
   - Verify seed data creation succeeds
   - Confirm Playwright tests run without browser issues

2. Monitor load testing (if triggered)
   - Check performance baseline established
   - Verify regression detection works

3. Monitor daily/weekly automation
   - Dependency review
   - Stale workflow cleanup
   - CodeQL scanning

### Medium-term (Ongoing)

1. Watch for flaky health checks
   - May indicate timing issues
   - Adjust timeouts if needed

2. Monitor test result artifacts
   - Look for consistent patterns of failure
   - Refine test data seeding if needed

3. Review load test trends
   - Establish performance baseline
   - Watch for regressions

## 🎓 Lessons Learned for the Team

### GitHub Actions Best Practices Confirmed

1. **Health Checks Should Be Robust**
   - Use retry loops (not single attempt)
   - Check multiple endpoints
   - Provide detailed error output on failure

2. **Database Initialization Matters**
   - Run migrations before seed data
   - Use persistent DB for E2E (to keep seed data)
   - Use in-memory DB for unit tests (faster, isolated)

3. **Environment Configuration is Critical**
   - Disable CSRF for API test clients
   - Set appropriate auth modes per test type
   - Disable rate limiting in CI (otherwise tests will fail)

4. **Error Recovery is Essential**
   - Capture logs on failure
   - Upload artifacts for debugging
   - Use `continue-on-error: true` for non-critical steps
   - Provide detailed debugging output

5. **Concurrency Control is Important**
   - Use workflow groups for cancel-on-new-push
   - Prevents resource contention
   - Keeps CI queue moving

### Parameter Naming Matters

**Never discovered parameters should be validated against actual script definitions:**
- `COMMIT_READY.ps1` supports: `-Quick`, `-Standard`, `-Full`, `-Cleanup`, `-NonInteractive`, `-Help` ✅
- `VERIFY_VERSION.ps1` supports: `-CIMode`, `-CheckOnly`, `-NonInteractive`, `-Help` ✅

**Wrong parameters silently fail in PowerShell.** Always test script parameters before using in CI!
