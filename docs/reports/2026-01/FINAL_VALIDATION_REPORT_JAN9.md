## 🎓 POLICY ENFORCEMENT SUMMARY

### 6 Mandatory Policies

1. **Testing** - ALWAYS use batch runner
   - Prevents VS Code crashes
   - Enforced via RUN_TESTS_BATCH.ps1

2. **Planning & Versioning** - Single source of truth
   - Single planning document: UNIFIED_WORK_PLAN.md
   - Single version: $11.15.2 from VERSION file
   - Format: v1.MINOR.PATCH only

3. **Database** - Alembic migrations only
   - No direct schema edits
   - Version-controlled changes

4. **Frontend** - i18n always required
   - No hardcoded strings
   - Translation keys everywhere

5. **Pre-Commit** - Validation always required
   - COMMIT_READY.ps1 before every commit
   - Auto-fixes formatting

6. **Documentation** - Audit before creating
   - Check DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md first
   - Consolidate into existing framework

### 5-Layer Discovery Mechanism

Every agent will see policies through:
1. `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (auto-loaded)
2. `docs/AGENT_POLICY_ENFORCEMENT.md` (mandatory)
3. `DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md` (high visibility)
4. `docs/AGENT_QUICK_START.md` (onboarding)
5. `README.md` (project overview)
