## 🚀 GitHub Release Creation (Complete - Updated Jan 6, 2026)

**URL**: https://github.com/bs1gr/AUT_MIEEK_SMS/releases/tag/1.15.0

### ✅ Release Created/Updated Successfully

The release was updated with comprehensive notes using the automated method below.

---

## 📖 Future Release Creation Methods

For future releases (1.16.0+), use one of these methods:

### Method 1: Automated (Recommended - via gh CLI)

**Prerequisites**: GitHub CLI installed and authenticated

```powershell
# Install GitHub CLI (if not already installed)
winget install --id GitHub.cli

# Authenticate (first time only)
gh auth login

# Validate release readiness
.\RELEASE_HELPER.ps1 -Action ValidateRelease

# Create release automatically
.\RELEASE_HELPER.ps1 -Action CreateRelease

# For custom version tag
.\.RELEASE_HELPER.ps1 -Action CreateRelease -Tag 1.15.0
```

**What it does**:
- ✅ Extracts release body from `docs/releases/GITHUB_RELEASE_v{version}.md`
- ✅ Creates GitHub release with proper title and formatted notes
- ✅ Targets main branch automatically
- ✅ Checks if release exists (offers to update if found)
- ✅ Complete automation - no manual copying needed

**Script**: `RELEASE_HELPER.ps1` (updated Jan 6, 2026 with `CreateRelease` action)
