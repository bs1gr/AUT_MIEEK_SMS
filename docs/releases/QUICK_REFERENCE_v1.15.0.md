## 💡 Pro Tips

✓ **Read the pattern first** - Most code is already written in IMPLEMENTATION_PATTERNS.md

✓ **Tests as you code** - Don't save testing for end (use test patterns from tracker)

✓ **Commit early, commit often** - Small commits = easier review

✓ **Update the tracker daily** - Helps team track progress

✓ **Ask for help early** - Better to ask at day 1 than day 3

✓ **Reference pattern + section** - "See IMPLEMENTATION_PATTERNS.md → Audit Logging"
