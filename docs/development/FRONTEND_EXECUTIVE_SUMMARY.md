## ✅ STRENGTHS

### 1. Excellent Hook-Based Architecture

The codebase leverages React hooks effectively with custom hooks for:

- **Data Fetching:** `useStudents()`, `useCourses()` (React Query integration)
- **Mutations:** `useCreateStudent()`, `useUpdateStudent()`, `useDeleteStudent()`
- **UI State:** `useModal()` for generic modal management
- **Performance:** `useVirtualScroll()` for large lists
- **Auto-save:** `useAutosave()` for seamless updates

**Impact:** Code reuse, type safety, testability - excellent foundation for scaling.

### 2. Proper State Separation

```text
Server State (React Query) → Cached API data with automatic invalidation
Client State (Zustand)    → UI selections, filters, modals
Global State (Context)    → Auth, language, theme
Local State (useState)    → Component-level temporary data

```text
**Impact:** Each data type stored optimally, no Redux bloat, minimal boilerplate.

### 3. Full TypeScript Coverage

All components, hooks, and services are typed:

- Interfaces for API responses
- Props interfaces with JSDoc
- Type-safe mutation/query functions
- Generic hooks with proper inference

**Impact:** IDE autocomplete, fewer runtime errors, refactoring confidence.

### 4. Comprehensive Testing Infrastructure

- ✅ Vitest configured with 1000+ passing tests
- ✅ React Testing Library for component tests
- ✅ Mock API setup for integration tests
- ✅ Test patterns established and documented
- ✅ Good coverage of critical paths

**Impact:** Confidence in code changes, catch regressions early.

### 5. Professional Error Handling

- Error boundaries catch React render errors
- API error interceptor handles 401 redirects
- User-friendly error messages
- Error recovery strategies in place

**Impact:** Better UX, fewer user reports, resilience.

### 6. Internationalization Ready

- i18next configured for English (EN) and Greek (EL)
- Modular locale structure (separate files per feature)
- Type-safe translation keys
- Language toggle in navigation

**Impact:** Ready for global markets, maintainable translations.

### 7. Modern Development Workflow

- Vite 7.2.2 with fast HMR (285ms startup)
- PWA support (service workers)
- Environment-based configuration
- Pre-commit validation (COMMIT_READY.ps1)

**Impact:** Developer productivity, fast feedback loops.
