## 🎯 Key Findings

### ✅ What's Working Well

1. **Modern Hook Architecture** - Custom hooks for queries (useStudents, useCourses), modals (useModal), state management
2. **Excellent State Separation** - Server state (React Query), Client state (Zustand), Global state (Context), Local state (useState)
3. **Type Safety** - Full TypeScript coverage with proper interfaces and types
4. **Testing Infrastructure** - Vitest + React Testing Library with unit tests
5. **Error Boundaries** - Proper error handling with ErrorBoundary components
6. **Bilingual Support** - i18n setup for EN/EL with modular structure
7. **API Integration** - Clean axios client with auth interceptor, automatic token management
8. **Auth System** - Context-based auth with auto-login, token refresh via HttpOnly cookies
9. **Proper Separation of Concerns** - Features directory, components, hooks, stores, utils
10. **Performance-aware Code** - Already using useCallback, useMemo, lazy imports

### 🎯 Priority Improvements

| 6 | Form validation duplication | Zod schemas | ⭐⭐ Medium | ⭐⭐⭐ High |
| 7 | Unknown slowdowns | Performance monitoring | ⭐⭐ Medium | ⭐⭐⭐ High |
| 8 | Large initial load | Code splitting routes | ⭐⭐ Medium | ⭐⭐ Medium |
| 9 | Bundle bloat | Tree-shaking, lighter deps | ⭐⭐ Medium | ⭐⭐ Medium |
| 10 | Coverage gaps | Integration + perf tests | ⭐⭐⭐ High | ⭐⭐⭐ High |

## 📝 Notes

### Architecture Philosophy

Your codebase follows **Feature-First Architecture**, which is excellent:

```text
features/
├── students/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── hooks/ (useStudents, useStudentModals)
│   └── index.ts (public API)
├── courses/
│   └── ...
└── grades/
    └── ...

stores/
├── useStudentsStore (Zustand - client state)
├── useCoursesStore
└── ...

hooks/
├── useQuery, useMutation wrappers
└── useModal, useVirtualScroll

```text
This separates concerns perfectly and scales well.

### Best Practices Already Implemented

- ✅ Custom hooks for logic reuse
- ✅ Zustand for minimal state management
- ✅ React Query for server state
- ✅ Error boundaries for resilience
- ✅ i18n for internationalization
- ✅ TypeScript for type safety
- ✅ Testing infrastructure
- ✅ Proper authentication flow
- ✅ Authorization checks on routes
- ✅ Clean separation of API, services, components

### Emerging Patterns to Establish

- 🔄 Performance monitoring (new)
- 🔄 Smart error recovery (enhanced)
- 🔄 Validation schemas (centralized)
- 🔄 Memoization enforcement (expanded)
- 🔄 Bundle optimization (formalized)
