## 🔍 How to Monitor CI/CD

### Method 1: GitHub Actions Web Interface

**Step 1: Navigate to Actions**

```text
1. Go to: https://github.com/bs1gr/AUT_MIEEK_SMS/actions
2. Select "Latest workflow runs"
3. Click on the most recent run (top of list)

```text
**Step 2: Check Workflow Status**

```text
- Green checkmark (✓) = All checks passed
- Red X (✗) = One or more checks failed
- Yellow circle (◔) = In progress

```text
**Step 3: Review Job Results**

```text
Click on individual jobs to see:
- Backend tests (pytest)
- Frontend tests (vitest)
- E2E tests (playwright)
- Linting and formatting
- Docker build

```text
**Step 4: View Logs**

```text
Expand each job to see detailed logs
Look for:
- ERROR: Failed assertions
- FAILED: Test failures
- Exit code: 1 (indicates failure)

```text
---

### Method 2: Command Line Monitoring

#### Check latest workflow status

```powershell
# View GitHub Actions from CLI (requires GitHub CLI)

gh run list --repo bs1gr/AUT_MIEEK_SMS --branch main --limit 5

# Or check git log for recent pushes

git log --oneline -5 --graph

# Show latest 10 commits

git log --oneline -10

```text
#### Monitor specific workflow

```powershell
# Watch CI/CD pipeline

gh run watch --repo bs1gr/AUT_MIEEK_SMS

# Get detailed status

gh run view --repo bs1gr/AUT_MIEEK_SMS

```text
---

## ✅ Expected Results

### For `ca8b2db2f` (Latest: docs commit)

```text
✓ All pre-commit hooks passed
✓ Markdownlint passed
✓ No code changes (docs only) = no test runs needed
✓ Status: PASS

```text
### For `1483ed2f1` (RBAC implementation)

```text
Expected workflow: Full CI/CD pipeline
├── Pre-commit hooks: PASS (13/13)
├── Backend tests: PASS (370/370)
├── Frontend tests: PASS (1,249/1,249)
├── E2E tests: PASS (19+/24)
├── Docker build: PASS
├── Coverage: PASS (75% backend, 70% frontend)
└── Overall Status: PASS ✓

## 🚨 What to Watch For

### Critical Alerts

If you see any of these, **DO NOT** deploy to production:

1. **Test Failures**
   - Backend: Any test failing
   - Frontend: Any test failing
   - E2E: Critical path tests failing (auth, student CRUD)

2. **Build Failures**
   - Docker image build fails
   - Requirements conflict errors
   - Database migration errors

3. **Security Issues**
   - detect-secrets found credentials
   - SQL injection vulnerabilities
   - Authentication bypass

### Non-Critical Warnings

These can be proceeded with (will auto-fix on next commit):

1. **Code Style Issues** (auto-fixable by ruff)
2. **Markdown warnings** (usually benign)
3. **Coverage drops** (if above 70% threshold)

## 📈 CI/CD Performance Targets

| Metric | Target | Current | Status |
|--------|--------|---------|--------|
| Total CI time | <15 min | ~10-12 min | ✅ Good |
| Backend tests | <5 min | ~3-4 min | ✅ Good |
| Frontend tests | <3 min | ~2-3 min | ✅ Good |
| E2E tests | <5 min | ~4-5 min | ✅ Good |
| Docker build | <5 min | ~3-4 min | ✅ Good |
| Coverage report | <1 min | <1 min | ✅ Good |

## 🔄 Continuous Monitoring Schedule

### Every 30 minutes (during active development)

- [ ] Check latest workflow status
- [ ] Verify all checks still passing
- [ ] Watch for any new failures

### Every 2 hours

- [ ] Review logs for any warnings
- [ ] Check performance metrics
- [ ] Verify no regressions

### Daily (morning standup)

- [ ] Review last 24 hours of CI runs
- [ ] Document any failures or patterns
- [ ] Plan fixes if needed

### Weekly (Friday)

- [ ] Analyze CI/CD performance trends
- [ ] Update baseline metrics
- [ ] Optimize slow checks if needed

---

## 📋 Post-CI Approval Checklist

Once all CI/CD checks pass, verify:

- [ ] All 13 pre-commit hooks passed
- [ ] 370/370 backend tests passing
- [ ] 1,249/1,249 frontend tests passing
- [ ] 19+/24 E2E tests passing (100% critical)
- [ ] Docker build successful
- [ ] Coverage thresholds met
- [ ] No regressions detected
- [ ] Performance within targets

## 🚀 Next Steps After CI Passes

1. **Immediate (5 min)**
   - Verify all green checkmarks ✓
   - No red X or yellow circles

2. **Short-term (30 min)**
   - Review deployment readiness
   - Check staging capacity
   - Record the historical ready-state outcome for the rollout log

3. **Medium-term (2-4 hours)**
   - Deploy to staging
   - Run RBAC seeding
   - Execute validation tests

4. **Long-term (24 hours)**
   - Monitor staging for errors
   - Collect performance metrics
   - Prepare production deployment

## 📞 Historical Escalation Routing

If this historical CI/CD pipeline reference shows a failure:

| Historical Role | Contact | Availability |
|------|---------|---------------|
| **Deployment operator** | Check archived rollout list | Business hours |
| **Backend maintainer** | Check archived rollout list | Business hours |
| **QA reviewer** | Check archived rollout list | Business hours |
| **Rollout owner** | Check archived rollout list | Historical on-call reference |
