**Trigger Conditions:**
- ❌ API health endpoint down (500 errors)
- ❌ Database connection lost
- ❌ All containers stopped
- ❌ Disk space <5% free
- ❌ p95 response time >5000ms

**Action:**
1. Check Slack/Teams notifications
2. Open incident response runbook: `docs/deployment/INCIDENT_RESPONSE_RUNBOOK.md`
3. Follow emergency procedures
4. Notify stakeholders immediately

### High Priority (Response within 5-15 min)
