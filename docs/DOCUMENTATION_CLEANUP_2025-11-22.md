# Documentation Cleanup Summary (2025-11-22)

## Scope

Review of new/modified documentation introduced with the Session Export/Import feature and Docker auth defaults fix. Objective: align docs with code changes, reduce redundancy, and classify internal vs user-facing material.

## New / Updated Documents


| File | Purpose | Audience | Action |
|------|---------|----------|--------|
| `README.md` | High-level feature overview incl. Session Export/Import section | All users | Updated with guide link ✅ |
| `docs/user/SESSION_EXPORT_IMPORT_GUIDE.md` | Practical step-by-step usage scenarios & troubleshooting | End users / operators | Keep (primary user guide) ✅ |
| `SESSION_EXPORT_IMPORT_FEATURE.md` | Deep implementation notes, data flow, internal details | Developers | Keep (dev reference). Consider moving to `docs/dev/` later |
| `SESSION_IMPORT_SAFETY_ENHANCEMENTS.md` | Validation, backup, rollback design & safety rationale | Developers / Ops | Keep. Merge with feature doc in a future consolidation |
| `DOCKER_AUTH_FIX.md` | Clarifies Docker auth defaults & remediation steps | Operators | Keep (high signal, recent fix) ✅ |
| `QNAP_DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md` | Master deployment plan for NAS environments | Operators / DevOps | Keep (core deployment artifact) ✅ |

## Redundancy Assessment


The three session-related docs serve distinct layers:

1. User workflow (GUIDE) – minimal, task-centric
2. Implementation (FEATURE) – architecture & serialization details
3. Safety internals (SAFETY_ENHANCEMENTS) – validation logic & rollback semantics

They are complementary; no immediate deletion recommended. Future consolidation could merge (2) and (3) into a single `SESSION_EXPORT_IMPORT_INTERNALS.md` under a `docs/dev/` directory.

## Recommended Follow-Up (Deferred)


1. Create `docs/dev/` folder; relocate:
   - `SESSION_EXPORT_IMPORT_FEATURE.md`
   - `SESSION_IMPORT_SAFETY_ENHANCEMENTS.md`
2. Add cross-links between internal doc and user guide.
3. Add CHANGELOG deprecation notice when POST export is removed.
4. Add automated test references (planned tests for rollback & dry-run) once implemented.

## Obsolete / Deprecated Check


No newly added files are obsolete. Legacy references to POST-only export were removed; README and CHANGELOG reflect GET addition and future POST deprecation.

## Alignment Verification


| Aspect | Implemented | Documented |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| GET export endpoint | Yes | README, CHANGELOG, GUIDE |
| Dry-run validation | Yes | README, GUIDE, SAFETY_ENHANCEMENTS |
| Automatic backup & rollback | Yes | README, SAFETY_ENHANCEMENTS, GUIDE |
| Legacy `component_type` handling | Yes | CHANGELOG (Added section) |
| Filename Unicode sanitization | Yes | CHANGELOG, README |
| Docker auth defaults fix | Yes | CHANGELOG, DOCKER_AUTH_FIX.md |

## Summary

Documentation aligns with current code changes. No deletions performed; classification added for future restructuring. User-facing material is concise; deeper technical detail preserved for developers.
