# CI Reports

This folder contains CI-related diagnostic and failure reports (e.g., GitHub Actions diagnostics and failure summaries). These documents help trace and analyze pipeline behavior over time.

Conventions:
- Filenames prefixed with `GITHUB_ACTIONS_` or similar CI sources
- Add dates or versions when relevant (YYYY-MM-DD or vX.Y.Z)
