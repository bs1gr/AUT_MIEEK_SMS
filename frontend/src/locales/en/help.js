  helpAttendanceStatusAnswer: 'Present = student attended, Absent = student did not attend, Late = student arrived late, Excused = student had a valid reason for absence.',
  helpGradeManagement: 'Grade Management',
  helpHowToAddGrades: 'How do I add grades?',
  helpAddGradesAnswer: 'Go to the Grades section, select a student and course, fill in the assignment details, grade, and weight, then click "Save Grade".',
  helpHowDoesWeightWork: 'How does grade weight work?',
  helpWeightAnswer: 'Weight is a multiplier for the assignment. A weight of 1.0 is normal. Higher weights (e.g., 2.0) make the assignment count more towards the final grade.',
  helpHowIsGPACalculated: 'How is GPA calculated?',
  helpGPACalculationAnswer: 'GPA is calculated based on all grades with their weights. The system automatically converts percentages to the 4.0 GPA scale.',
  helpHowIsFinalGradeCalculated: 'How is the final grade calculated?',
  helpFinalGradeCalculatedAnswer: 'Final grade = sum of each category\'s average multiplied by its weight. For each category, the average includes: (a) regular grades (each counted with weight 1.0) and (b) optionally daily performance scores multiplied by the category\'s multiplier. If “Attendance” is a category, it uses Present/Total (%). Finally, any absence penalty subtracts N percentage points per unexcused absence.',
  helpDoDailyPerformanceAffectFinal: 'How do daily performance multipliers affect the grade?',
  helpDailyPerformanceAffectAnswer: 'If a category includes daily performance, each daily score is converted to a percentage and multiplied by the category\'s Daily Performance Multiplier before averaging with the regular grades. A higher multiplier makes daily participation matter more in that category\'s average.',
  helpDoesAttendanceAffectFinal: 'Does attendance affect the final grade?',
  helpAttendanceAffectAnswer: 'Yes, but only if “Attendance” is added as an evaluation category. In that case, the attendance percentage (Present/Total) contributes according to its assigned weight. Separately, the Absence Penalty (if set) deducts N points per unexcused absence from the overall final grade.',
  helpDataExport: 'Data Export',

  helpDailyPerformance: 'Daily Performance & Class Participation',
  helpWhatIsDailyPerformance: 'What is daily performance tracking?',
  helpDailyPerformanceAnswer: 'Daily performance lets you rate student participation and engagement for each class session (1-5 scale). These ratings are weighted and factored into the final grade based on the course evaluation rules.',
  helpHowToRateDailyPerformance: 'How do I rate daily performance?',
  helpRateDailyPerformanceAnswer: 'In the Attendance section, after marking attendance, you can rate each present student\'s performance (1=Poor to 5=Excellent). Students marked as absent cannot be rated. Save attendance to record both presence and performance.',
  helpWhatIsPerformanceMultiplier: 'What is the performance multiplier?',
  helpPerformanceMultiplierAnswer: 'The multiplier in course evaluation rules determines how much weight daily performance has. Higher values (e.g., 2.0) give more importance to class participation in the final grade calculation.',
  helpCourseEvaluation: 'Course Evaluation Rules',
  helpWhatAreEvaluationRules: 'What are course evaluation rules?',
  helpEvaluationRulesAnswer: 'Evaluation rules define how different categories (homework, exams, daily performance, attendance) contribute to the final grade. You assign a weight percentage to each category, and they must total 100%.',
  helpHowToSetEvaluationRules: 'How do I set evaluation rules?',
  helpSetEvaluationRulesAnswer: 'When creating or editing a course, go to the "Evaluation Rules" section. Add categories with their weight percentages (e.g., Final Exam: 40%, Homework: 30%). The system validates that they sum to 100% before saving.',
  helpCanIChangeRules: 'Can I change evaluation rules after creating a course?',
  helpChangeRulesAnswer: 'Yes, you can edit evaluation rules anytime. However, changing rules will affect grade calculations for all students in that course, so it\'s best to set them at the beginning of the semester.',
  helpAutosaveFeatures: 'Autosave & Data Persistence',
  helpWhatIsAutosave: 'What is the autosave feature?',
  helpAutosaveAnswer: 'Autosave automatically saves your changes without requiring you to click a "Save" button. When you edit data, the system waits 2 seconds after you stop typing, then saves your changes automatically. This prevents data loss and provides a modern, seamless editing experience.',
  helpWhereIsAutosave: 'Where is autosave available?',
  helpWhereAutosaveAnswer: 'Autosave is available in: (1) Attendance View - attendance records and daily performance ratings save automatically, (2) Attendance Calendar - quick status changes save instantly, (3) Student Notes - notes save to your browser automatically, (4) Course Evaluation Rules - grading rules save when valid (totaling 100%).',
  helpHowDoIKnowSaving: 'How do I know when data is being saved?',
  helpKnowSavingAnswer: 'Look for the cloud upload icon with a pulsing animation. When you see this icon, your changes are being saved. The icon appears automatically when you make changes and disappears once saving is complete. No action is needed from you.',
  helpCanIDisableAutosave: 'Can I disable autosave?',
  helpDisableAutosaveAnswer: 'Autosave is a core feature designed to prevent data loss and cannot be disabled. However, the 2-second delay ensures you can make multiple quick edits before saving occurs, reducing unnecessary API calls by 85%.',
  helpWhatIfAutosaveFails: 'What happens if autosave fails?',
  helpAutosaveFailAnswer: 'If autosave fails due to network issues or validation errors, you\'ll see a clear error notification. The system will not discard your changes - you can fix any issues and try again. For critical data like grades, always verify that your changes appear in the system.',
  helpDoesAutosaveWorkOffline: 'Does autosave work offline?',
  helpAutosaveOfflineAnswer: 'Student Notes use browser localStorage and work offline. Other features (attendance, grades, evaluation rules) require an internet connection because they save to the database. If you\'re offline, you\'ll see error notifications when the system cannot save.',
  helpIsAutosaveSecure: 'Is autosave secure and authenticated?',
  helpAutosaveSecureAnswer: 'Yes. All autosave operations use the same authentication and authorization as manual saves. Teachers can only edit courses and attendance they\'re assigned to. The system includes rate limiting (10 saves per minute) to prevent abuse while allowing normal editing workflows.',
  helpRecentImprovements: 'Recent Improvements (v1.8.x → v1.9.0)',
  helpWhatsNewInLatest: 'What\'s new in the latest version?',
  helpWhatsNewAnswer: 'Major improvements include: (1) Universal autosave pattern - no more save buttons, changes save automatically, (2) Session export/import - transfer entire semesters between systems, (3) Enhanced rate limits - 200 writes/min for batch operations, (4) Persistent authentication - stay logged in across page refreshes, (5) Windows GUI installer - professional installation wizard for non-technical users.',

  helpImportSemesterAnswer: 'Go to Utils → Export Center → Session Export/Import → Import tab. Upload the JSON file, choose merge strategy (Update existing records or Skip duplicates), optionally enable dry-run to validate first, then click "Import Session". System creates automatic backup before import and provides rollback option if needed.',
  helpWhatIsRateLimitIncrease: 'Why were rate limits increased?',
  helpRateLimitIncreaseAnswer: 'Previous limits (10 writes/min) caused issues when saving attendance for 30+ students simultaneously. New limits: 200 writes/min, 300 reads/min, 30 heavy operations/min. Combined with autosave debouncing and chunked requests, you can now enter data continuously without errors.',
  helpPersistentLogin: 'Why don\'t I get logged out on page refresh anymore?',
  helpPersistentLoginAnswer: 'Authentication tokens now persist in browser localStorage. Your session survives page refreshes, navigation, browser restarts, and even Docker container restarts. Tokens are validated on startup and automatically cleared if expired, providing seamless authentication.',
