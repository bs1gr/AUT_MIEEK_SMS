  helpHowDoesWeightWork: 'How does grade weight work?',
  helpWeightAnswer: 'Weight is a multiplier for the assignment. A weight of 1.0 is normal. Higher weights (e.g., 2.0) make the assignment count more towards the final grade.',
  helpHowIsGPACalculated: 'How is GPA calculated?',
  helpGPACalculationAnswer: 'GPA is calculated based on all grades with their weights. The system automatically converts percentages to the 4.0 GPA scale.',
  helpHowIsFinalGradeCalculated: 'How is the final grade calculated?',
  helpFinalGradeCalculatedAnswer: 'Final grade = sum of each category\'s average multiplied by its weight. For each category, the average includes: (a) regular grades (each counted with weight 1.0) and (b) optionally daily performance scores multiplied by the category\'s multiplier. If “Attendance” is a category, it uses Present/Total (%). Finally, any absence penalty subtracts N percentage points per unexcused absence.',
  helpDoDailyPerformanceAffectFinal: 'How do daily performance multipliers affect the grade?',
  helpDailyPerformanceAffectAnswer: 'If a category includes daily performance, each daily score is converted to a percentage and multiplied by the category\'s Daily Performance Multiplier before averaging with the regular grades. A higher multiplier makes daily participation matter more in that category\'s average.',
  helpDoesAttendanceAffectFinal: 'Does attendance affect the final grade?',
  helpAttendanceAffectAnswer: 'Yes, but only if “Attendance” is added as an evaluation category. In that case, the attendance percentage (Present/Total) contributes according to its assigned weight. Separately, the Absence Penalty (if set) deducts N points per unexcused absence from the overall final grade.',

  helpWhatIsGreekGrade: 'What is the Greek grade scale?',
  helpGreekGradeAnswer: 'The Greek scale is 0-20, commonly used in Greek educational institutions. The system automatically converts your percentage grade (0-100%) to the Greek scale. For example: 100% = 20, 90% = 18, 50% = 10.',
  helpCleanupObsolete: 'What does "Cleanup obsolete files" do?',
  helpCleanupObsoleteAnswer: 'Removes non-essential and outdated documentation files (e.g., old markdowns) defined by the project policy. Run it from Control Panel → Operations only when the backend runs directly on your host, or run scripts/CLEANUP_OBSOLETE_FILES.ps1 from the repo root on Windows. When the backend runs inside Docker, it cannot modify host files; the UI will show a host-only notice.',
  helpDockerVolumeUpdate: 'What is "Update Docker Data Volume"?',
  helpDockerVolumeUpdateAnswer: 'Creates a new versioned Docker volume for backend data (mounted at /data), optionally migrates data from the current volume, and writes docker-compose.override.yml to switch the backend to the new volume. Old volumes are preserved for safety.',
  helpUpdateVolumeHowTo: 'How do I update the data volume safely?',
  helpUpdateVolumeHowToAnswer: 'Either use Control Panel → Operations (host backend only) or run scripts/DOCKER_UPDATE_VOLUME.ps1. After creation, apply the change by running: docker compose down, then docker compose up -d. The override file controls which volume is used.',
  helpUpdateVolumeRevert: 'How do I revert to the previous volume?',
  helpUpdateVolumeRevertAnswer: 'Edit or delete docker-compose.override.yml and restart the stack (docker compose down/up). You can also re-run the script to create and switch to another volume. Old volumes remain available.',

  helpDailyPerformance: 'Daily Performance & Class Participation',
  helpWhatIsDailyPerformance: 'What is daily performance tracking?',
  helpDailyPerformanceAnswer: 'Daily performance lets you rate student participation and engagement for each class session (1-5 scale). These ratings are weighted and factored into the final grade based on the course evaluation rules.',
  helpHowToRateDailyPerformance: 'How do I rate daily performance?',
  helpRateDailyPerformanceAnswer: 'In the Attendance section, after marking attendance, you can rate each present student\'s performance (1=Poor to 5=Excellent). Students marked as absent cannot be rated. Save attendance to record both presence and performance.',
  helpWhatIsPerformanceMultiplier: 'What is the performance multiplier?',
  helpPerformanceMultiplierAnswer: 'The multiplier in course evaluation rules determines how much weight daily performance has. Higher values (e.g., 2.0) give more importance to class participation in the final grade calculation.',
  helpCourseEvaluation: 'Course Evaluation Rules',
  helpWhatAreEvaluationRules: 'What are course evaluation rules?',
  helpEvaluationRulesAnswer: 'Evaluation rules define how different categories (homework, exams, daily performance, attendance) contribute to the final grade. You assign a weight percentage to each category, and they must total 100%.',
  helpHowToSetEvaluationRules: 'How do I set evaluation rules?',

  helpWhyGreekEnglishCategories: 'Why are category names shown in Greek but saved in English?',
  helpLocalizationCategoriesAnswer: 'To keep analytics consistent and avoid mismatches, the system stores canonical category names in English on the backend, while displaying them in Greek in the UI. You can type in Greek; the app maps it to the correct canonical English category when saving.',
  helpArePlaceholdersBilingual: 'Are examples and suggestions bilingual (e.g., datalists and “e.g.” text)?',
  helpPlaceholdersBilingualAnswer: 'Yes. Placeholders like “e.g.” and category suggestions are localized. In Greek, you\'ll see “π.χ.” and bilingual suggestions to help you recognize categories. Inputs you type in Greek are normalized on save so the backend remains consistent.',
  helpSystemManagement: 'Database & System Management',
  helpHowToBackup: 'How do I backup my data?',
