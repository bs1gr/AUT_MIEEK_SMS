feat(ui): Add automatic monitoring stack startup from React UI

Implemented intelligent auto-start functionality for Grafana and Prometheus
monitoring services directly from the Power page UI, eliminating the need
for manual RUN.ps1 -WithMonitoring command execution.

Features:
- Smart service detection with real-time status indicators
- Automatic monitoring stack startup on button click
- Confirmation prompts before starting services
- Loading states and progress indicators
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Conditional iframe embedding (only when services running)
- 10-second auto-refresh of monitoring status
- TypeScript type safety for all API interactions

User Experience Improvements:
- Status badges: "● Running" (green) / "○ Stopped" (gray)
- Click "Open Grafana/Prometheus" → auto-prompts to start if stopped
- Beautiful loading animations during 5-8 second startup
- Graceful fallback messages when services unavailable
- Info tooltips explaining auto-start behavior

Technical Implementation:
- Uses /control/api/monitoring/status endpoint for status checks
- Uses /control/api/monitoring/start endpoint for service startup
- Polling interval: 10 seconds for status updates
- Startup delay: 8 seconds before opening service URLs
- Full TypeScript interfaces for MonitoringStatus and MonitoringService

Benefits:
- No PowerShell commands needed - everything in UI
- Seamless integration with existing Control Panel
- Better visibility of monitoring service status
- Improved developer and operator experience

Breaking Changes: None
Dependencies: Uses existing Control API endpoints

Modified:
- frontend/src/pages/PowerPage.tsx: +150 lines (status detection, auto-start logic, UI enhancements)
