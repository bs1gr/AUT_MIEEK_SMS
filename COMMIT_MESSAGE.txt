test(e2e): align Students E2E with card-based UI (no table)

Context: Latest E2E run (#33) failed on Students suite due to waiting for a <table>
that the current UI no longer renders. Students view uses card list (ul > li)
and an empty-state message. Updated tests to be resilient and match actual UI.

Changes:
- critical-flows.spec.ts: Replace table-based selectors with robust checks that
  wait for either student cards (li.border) or the empty-state message (EN/EL).
- Search test: After filling search, wait for cards or empty-state rather than table.
- Detail test: Click "View Profile" on first card and assert StudentProfile rendered
  by checking for Student ID label (EN/EL). Gracefully skip when no students.

Validation:
- Ran COMMIT_READY.ps1 -Quick: all lint/tests passed, translation integrity OK.
- Frontend Vitest: 53 files queued, 25 tests run, all passed.
- Backend pytest: suite passed.

Follow-ups:
- Push to trigger E2E workflow and verify Students suite stability in CI.
